\chapter{Conclusion}
Table \ref{tab:weighavgrecall} and \ref{tab:weighavgprec} show that the model yielding highest results both for precision and accuracy is onehidden\_red. Considering the second best (twohidden\_red), we notice it achieves the best result only when it comes to the precision for predictions about samples coming from the first class. In the majority of the other cases it is beaten by either onehidden or onehidden\_red. Being the second best means that the model manages to keep high average precision and recall scores, but it does not stand out in the classification of any specific class. In addition to this its average accuracy is positively influenced by its recall ($0.7182$) in predictions related to samples belonging to the majority class. The onehidden model's scores are often really good both in precision and recall, but its average accuracy suffers from a low recall in the predictions inherent to the first class (which causes a decrease of the precision scores of all the other classes for said model). Similar observations can be done for the twohidden model, which is weak in recognising the samples belonging to the majority class. This model, though, has a really high recall value for recognising the samples belonging to the minority class, but this result is not really impressive because of the low precision score on the same class (which means that many samples belonging to other classes are recognised as belonging to the minority one). Finally, the baseline model does not obtain any good result, with an average accuracy of $0.5598$ (our best model scores $0.7435$) and an average precision of $0.6964$ (our best model scores $0.7833$).
