\chapter{Problem introduction}
Through this project we intend to become familiar with imbalanced multi-class supervised classification problems. To serve this purpose, we decided to explore the Forest Cover type dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset comprises observations taken from 30m by 30m patches of the Roosevelt National Forest (in northern Colorado) that are labelled upon the main cover type of that patch.

\section{Dataset overview}
The training set counts $15\,120$ observations while the test set $565\,892$. The data comes from the US Geological Survey
(USGS) and the US Forest Service (USFS). For each patch the following 12 variables (and their units of measurement) plus the labels are provided:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Elevation (m),
	\item Aspect (azimuth from true north),
	\item Slope ($^{\circ}$),
	\item Horizontal distance to nearest surface water feature (m),
	\item Vertical distance to nearest surface water feature (m),
	\item Horizontal distance to nearest roadway (m),
	\item Hillshade 9am: a relative measure of incident sunlight at 09:00 h on the summer solstice (index),
	\item Hillshade Noon: a relative measure of incident sunlight at noon on the summer solstice (index),
	\item Hillshade 3pm: a relative measure of incident sunlight at 15:00 h on the summer solstice (index),
	\item Horizontal distance to nearest historic wildfire ignition point (m),
	\item Wilderness area: the macro-area the patch belongs to (four binary values, one for each wilderness area),
	\item Soil type: the principal soil type in the patch (40 binary values, one for each soil type),
	\item Cover type: forest cover type (classes from 1 to 7, one for each patch).
\end{enumerate}
Table \ref{tab:covertypes} shows that the dataset is imbalanced. For an effective classifier all classes should be equally represented in the training set, thus it is necessary to reduce its size. According to \cite{blackardDean} the training set (which includes the validation data) should follow the approach of Figure \ref{fig:covertypesdims}. The relative sizes of the training and testing sets make the classification a challenging problem since the training set is $\sim2.6\%$ of the overall dataset.

\section{Feature engineering}
\label{sec:feat_eng}
It is important to notice that the analysis, from now on, has been done on the training set only (to avoid data leakage \cite{smialowski2009}). The total number of features is 54, thus, simple feature selection is done: for example, Figure \ref{fig:elevationhist} shows the elevation feature grouped by each cover type and it is quite clear that classes 4 (Cottonwood/Willow), 5 (Aspen) and 7 (Krummholz) are easily separable; focusing on the numerical features, Figure \ref{fig:fullcorrmatrix} shows the correlation plots for each of them and we noticed that the couples <<Vertical\_Distance\_To\_Hydrology - Horizontal\_Distance\_To\_Hydrology>> and <<Hillshade\_Noon - Hillshade\_3pm>> are both highly correlated (positive correlation coefficients are $0.6521$ and $0.6145$, respectively). Furthermore, the couple <<Hillshade\_9am - Hillshade\_3pm>> has a negative correlation coefficient equal to $-0.7800$. From these observations, two new features could substitute the ones used for their computation allowing us to reduce the dimension of the feature space:
\begin{itemize}
\item Distance\_To\_Hydrology: the Euclidean distance computed on Vertical\_Distance\_To\_Hydrology and Horizontal\_Distance\_To\_Hydrology,
\item Mean\_Hillshade: the mean value of the three Hillshade features.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, Hillshade\_3pm missing values ($88$ zeros) have been imputed with the median over all the training samples and one-hot encoding has been applied to the target variable yielding 7 binary variables. Finally, the numerical features were scaled to zero mean and unit variance (standardization \cite{wiki:standardization}).
\subsection{Circular quantities scaling}
Scaling <<Aspect>> and <<Slope>> features via standardization can't be done in the usual way \cite{wiki:directionalstats}: being circular quantities it's necessary to recur to \textit{directional statistics} theory to compute the mean value and standard deviation of the two. Given $x\in(-\pi,\pi]$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\mu&=&\quad\text{atan2}\Bigg(\underbrace{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sin{x}}_{\mathcal{S}},\underbrace{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\cos{x}}_{\mathcal{C}}\Bigg) \text{,} \\
&\sigma&=&\quad\sqrt{-2\ln\left(\sqrt{\mathcal{C}^2+\mathcal{S}^2}\right)}\text{,}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}   
where $\mu$ is the mean value of the set and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
